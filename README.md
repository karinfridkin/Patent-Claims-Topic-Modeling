# Patent-Claims-Topic-Modeling
Our goal is to better understand competition in the mobile communications sector by studying patent claims. We want to create a method that groups patent claims into clear topics and use this method in a simple interactive tool. This tool should let users pick how many groups they want and show the names and number of claims in each group.
